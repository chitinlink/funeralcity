          <p>This site is an archive of "Ron Paul Funeral City", a surreal art piece written across multiple posts in what was previously an aesthetic/fashion tumblr blog. (possibly had a different URL before funeral city?)</p>
          <p>Not all of the blog's posts are archived here, only ones posted on and after July 12th, 2012, when Funeral City "began".</p>
          <p>The blog is still up, however inactive, and you can browse its <a href="https://ronpaulfuneralcity.tumblr.com/archive">archive</a>.</p>
          <p>A link to the original and a copy in the Internet Archive is available for every post.</p>
          <p>Edits have been made to accomodate the posts outside of Tumblr, to fix dead links, and remove extraneous spaces, but I tried to make sure the formatting was mostly the same.</p>
          <p>Everything here save for a few guest posts was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/Tetradugenikid">@Tetradugenikid</a>.</p>
